      <description>&lt;p&gt;O Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth! You are the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the One who spoke light into existence with a Word. By Your breath, the stars were flung into the expanse, each one declaring Your glory and craftsmanship. You are the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the Starter and Finisher, the Eternal One who transcends time and space. Before the mountains were brought forth, before the seas roared their praise, You were God, enthroned in majesty, clothed in light, and surrounded by the unending chorus of heavenly beings who shout: &amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty; the whole earth is full of His glory!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
